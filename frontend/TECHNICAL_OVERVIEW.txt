PATHWAY DIGITAL - Technical Overview
===================================

Project Structure:
------------------
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), located in `frontend/`
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, located in `backend/`

Frontend Details:
-----------------
- **Framework:** React (with TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** react-router-dom
- **State Management:** React Context API (for Auth, Cart, Wishlist)
- **HTTP Requests:** axios
- **PDF Generation:** jsPDF, jspdf-autotable
- **UI Libraries:** @headlessui/react, @heroicons/react, react-icons, react-hot-toast
- **Testing:** @testing-library/react, jest
- **Build Tool:** Create React App

Frontend Logic:
- User authentication (login, register, profile management)
- Product browsing, filtering, and searching
- Cart and wishlist management
- Checkout flow
- Quotation request and PDF download
- Repair job request and tracking
- Contact form for customer queries
- Admin dashboard for managing products, categories, users, queries, repairs, and quotations

Backend Details:
----------------
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (via mongoose)
- **Authentication:** JWT (jsonwebtoken), bcryptjs for password hashing
- **Security:** helmet, express-mongo-sanitize, xss-clean, express-rate-limit, cors
- **File Uploads:** multer
- **Email:** nodemailer
- **Logging:** winston, morgan
- **Validation:** express-validator
- **Environment Variables:** dotenv

Backend Logic:
- RESTful API endpoints for products, categories, users, orders, queries, quotations, repairs, and uploads
- User authentication and authorization (JWT-based)
- Admin-only routes for management features
- Product and category CRUD operations
- Repair job management and status tracking
- Quotation generation and management
- Customer query handling
- Image upload and management
- Email notifications for certain actions
- Data validation and error handling

How It Works:
-------------
- The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API endpoints.
- Users can browse products, register/login, manage their cart/wishlist, request repairs or quotations, and contact support.
- Admin users have access to a dashboard for managing all key resources.
- All sensitive operations are protected by authentication and role-based authorization.

Main Libraries Used:
--------------------
Frontend:
- react, react-dom, react-router-dom, axios, tailwindcss, jsPDF, react-hot-toast, @headlessui/react, @heroicons/react, react-icons

Backend:
- express, mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs, multer, nodemailer, helmet, cors, winston, morgan, express-validator, dotenv, express-mongo-sanitize, xss-clean, express-rate-limit

This structure ensures a modern, secure, and scalable web application for both customers and administrators.
